# weapon-detection-alert-location-share
This project focuses on enhancing the security of different places, like public areas and banks, by implementing a robust gun detection and location-sharing system. The system is designed to capture images from an IP camera strategically placed within the bank premises. When a captured image contains an identifiable gun, the system takes appropriate actions, such as sending alerts or sharing the location of the detected firearm.


1. **Image Capture:**

    Utilizes an IP camera to continuously capture images in real-time within the camera range.Images are processed and analyzed for potential gun presence.

2. **Gun Detection:**

    Employs advanced computer vision algorithms for accurate gun detection in captured images.
  The system recognizes various types of firearms and distinguishes them from other objects. 
3. Alert Systems:

    When a gun is detected, the system triggers immediate alerts.
Alerts can be configured to notify security personnel, law enforcement, and relevant authorities.
4. Location Sharing:

    If a gun is detected, the system captures the location of the incident.
The location information is shared in real-time with designated security personnel and law enforcement agencies.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ishworrsubedii/gun-detection-alert-location-share.git
    cd cd gun-detection
    ```

2. **Create and activate the Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n weapon-detection python=3.10 -y
    conda activate gun-detection
    ```

3. **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Perform Inference/Prediction:**
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
   
   - We have to run both programs for inference. py for fastapi post request and streamlit for UI for the prediction.
